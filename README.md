#Text Processing Pipeline with OpenAI and Local LLM on Google Colab
This repository demonstrates a custom text processing pipeline that integrates OpenAI (or Gemini) API and a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM). The project includes prompt engineering, validation, and comparison of model outputs, and is designed to run seamlessly on Google Colab.

Features
OpenAI API Integration: Converts unstructured text into structured JSON outputs.
Local LLM Integration: Processes text using a locally hosted model (e.g., LLaMA, Falcon, or GPT-like models).
Prompt Engineering: Ensures accurate and consistent responses with tailored prompts.
Validation: Implements Pydantic models for response validation to ensure data integrity.
Comparison: Generates a side-by-side comparison of outputs from OpenAI and the local LLM.
Error Handling: Robust handling for API errors, rate limits, and invalid responses.
Getting Started on Google Colab
Prerequisites
Google Colab Account: Free or Pro subscription.
OpenAI API Key: Required for accessing OpenAI services.
Hugging Face Account (optional): For downloading models that might require authentication.
Setup
Open the Colab Notebook: Click on the link below to open the Colab notebook: Google Colab Notebook Link

Install Dependencies: All dependencies will be installed directly within the notebook:

python
Copy code
!pip install openai transformers torch pydantic
Set Up OpenAI API Key: Add your API key to the notebook:

python
Copy code
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key_here"
Load a Local Model (Optional): Authenticate with Hugging Face if the local model requires it:

python
Copy code
!huggingface-cli login
Run the Notebook: Execute all cells sequentially to process text and compare results.

Project Workflow
Input Text: Provide raw unstructured text in the input field.
Process with OpenAI:
Sends the text to OpenAI API using prompt engineering.
Process with Local LLM:
Uses a model like LLaMA or Falcon to process the same text locally.
Validation:
Validates the outputs using Pydantic models.
Comparison:
Displays structured JSON outputs from both methods side-by-side.
Example Outputs
Input Text:

Copy code
Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.
OpenAI Output:

json
Copy code
{
  "text": "Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "entities": ["AI", "healthcare"],
  "keywords": ["AI", "benefits", "healthcare"]
}
Local Model Output:

json
Copy code
{
  "text": "Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.",
  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "entities": ["AI"],
  "keywords": ["AI", "healthcare"]
}
