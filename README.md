# Text Processing Pipeline with OpenAI and Local LLM on Google Colab
This repository demonstrates a custom text processing pipeline that integrates OpenAI (or Gemini) API and a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM). The project includes prompt engineering, validation, and comparison of model outputs, and is designed to run seamlessly on Google Colab.

# Features
OpenAI API Integration: Converts unstructured text into structured JSON outputs.
Local LLM Integration: Processes text using a locally hosted model (e.g., LLaMA, Falcon, or GPT-like models).
Prompt Engineering: Ensures accurate and consistent responses with tailored prompts.
Validation: Implements Pydantic models for response validation to ensure data integrity.
Comparison: Generates a side-by-side comparison of outputs from OpenAI and the local LLM.
Error Handling: Robust handling for API errors, rate limits, and invalid responses.
# Getting Started on Google Colab
# Prerequisites
Google Colab Account: Free or Pro subscription.
OpenAI API Key: Required for accessing OpenAI services.
Hugging Face Account (optional): For downloading models that might require authentication.
# Setup
1. Open the Colab Notebook: Click on the link below to open the Colab notebook: Google Colab Notebook Link

2. Install Dependencies: All dependencies will be installed directly within the notebook:
   
```bash
!pip install openai transformers torch pydantic

3. Set Up OpenAI API Key: Add your API key to the notebook:
```bash
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key_here"

4.Load a Local Model (Optional): Authenticate with Hugging Face if the local model requires it:
```bash
!huggingface-cli login

5. Run the Notebook: Execute all cells sequentially to process text and compare results.

# Project Workflow
1. Input Text: Provide raw unstructured text in the input field.
2. Process with OpenAI:
    Sends the text to OpenAI API using prompt engineering.
3. Process with Local LLM:
    Uses a model like LLaMA or Falcon to process the same text locally.
4. Validation:
    Validates the outputs using Pydantic models.
5. Comparison:
    Displays structured JSON outputs from both methods side-by-side.

# Example Outputs

# Input Text:
```bash
Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.

# OpenAI Output:
```bash
{
  "text": "Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "entities": ["AI", "healthcare"],
  "keywords": ["AI", "benefits", "healthcare"]
}

# Local Model Output:
```bash
{
  "text": "Analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare.",
  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "entities": ["AI"],
  "keywords": ["AI", "healthcare"]
}
